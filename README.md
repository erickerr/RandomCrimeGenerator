# RandomCrimeGenerator
A random sentence generator for generating crimes

What is it?:

Enlist the Random Crime Generator (RCG) to generate near infinite crimes and punishments. It's literally a random *sentence* generator!

Example judgments:

"Comer stands accused of solarizing laboratories while liquidising."
"Frantz stands accused of codifying blueberries while restructuring."
"Crawford is guilty and has been sentenced to 16 years hard labour for individuating moths while schematising."

Random Crime Generator is written in Python 3. It is an open source game licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported License.
